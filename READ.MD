# Logic Circuit Visualiser

An interactive web-based tool for designing and simulating logic circuits. Users can add AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates, connect them with wires, and see real-time logic evaluations.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Drag-and-drop logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
- Visual wire connections.
- Interactive switch and lightbulb to test circuits.
- Reset functionality to clear the board.
- Sound effects for enhanced user interaction.

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite
- **Libraries:** React (if applicable), Canvas API for rendering wires
- **Hosting:** Vercel (live demo link below)

## ðŸ”¹ Live Demo
[ðŸ‘‰ https://belle-wills.github.io/Logic-Circuit/ 
as GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that isn't compatible for my backend, it currently isn't running. However, I'm happy to show a video demo of the backend working (saving and loading data) until both frontend and backend are fully published on a different site, that is compatible for both. 

## ðŸ”¹ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd logic-circuit-visualiser
